# Translation in the proposal workflow — working notes

Branch: `translation-workflow`, cut from `main` at `b8c8d05` on 30 September
2026, with `feat/translation` (`f69ecf6`) merged in. `feat/translation` is
Keith's branch (`Keith-paradox/launch-development`, `ee1181e`) plus one commit
of ours, described below. The pipeline itself is described in
[docs/jackson/DEV-31.md](jackson/DEV-31.md); this file records bringing it into
the proposal workflow, so that the automated merge after approval also
translates.

**Not merged into `main`.** It merges when the owner says so.

## The design, agreed 30 Sep

**The `approved` label is the staging dashboard.** The owner's call. The
reviewer keeps doing what they do today — the issue, the pull request, the
preview, the label — and approving a proposal is approving the English content
it produces, identified by its `contentHash`. That answers CP-4 (where the
approval record lives): in `data/decisions.js`, which the approval job already
writes. Rejected: a separate staging page with its own Approve/Reject buttons —
a second place to approve, for the same decision.

**Translate after approval, before the merge — and English does not wait.**
The approval job translates only the new strings, builds the French and
Portuguese pages, and merges English, French and Portuguese as one commit. If
the engine fails, it merges the English anyway and the new strings show in
English on `/fr` and `/pt` until the translate bot fills them. The second half
is not new: [source-registry-notes.md](source-registry-notes.md) already
records "English does not wait for French", rejecting a release held until every
language is complete because "one untranslated sentence then blocks a
registration update, which is the worse failure". An earlier draft of this
design (nothing merges if the engine fails) was that rejected alternative, and
was corrected before anything was built. Rejected: translating at intake, so
the preview shows French — it sends unapproved text to the engine and pays for
proposals that are then rejected.

**Changes made by hand are translated by a bot after they reach `main`.** The
page, `resistance.js`, `molecular-markers.js` and `sources.js` never go through
a proposal (53, 3, 1 and 1 commits on `main` from 30 Aug to 30 Sep). Each
changes the English that `content.en.json` records. Rejected: the person who
made the change runs the pipeline and commits the result, with CI going red if
they forget. Four reasons:

- nothing could enforce it — branch protection is unavailable on this plan
  (GitHub answers 403, "Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public"),
  so a red check does not stop the push;
- the repo already works the other way: `publish.yml` rebuilds generated files
  after a push, and `UPDATING.md` tells analysts CI does it "for you";
- the Google key would have to sit on every editor's machine, against DEV-31 §8
  ("organisation secrets, never personal accounts");
- the approval rule's own reasons (not paying for rejected sentences, no French
  for an unapproved claim) do not apply to a push to `main`, which is already
  live in English.

## Built on this branch

**1. The Sources footer is translated again, and the build checks for missing
files.** `main`'s `9c6be45` moved the footer from the page into
`data/sources.js`. `assemble-content.js` now collects what `renderSources()`
shows for each public entry — the name (`label`, or `title` where there is no
label), the `plain` line, and the `alsoSee` link labels — and puts the file in
`values`. The internal `findings` and `relevance` fields are never collected,
so they cannot reach an engine. `build-locale-pages.js` writes a localised
`sources.js`, and now copies every other data file the page's own `<script
src>` tags load instead of a fixed list — the fixed list is how the file went
missing. Its self-check gained "every data/ and assets/ file the page loads is
there"; with `pt/data/sources.js` removed it fails the build.

*Correction to "should need nothing new sent to Google", below.* Of the 48
strings the footer shows, 21 are in `translations.json` from when they were
markup; the other 27 belong to sources added to the registry after 23 Sep. With
this change `content.en.json` has 453 strings (276 data, 61 markup, 116 js) and
the dry run queues 33 per locale, 1,982 characters: those 27, the 3 new page
strings, and the 3 known rejects. Until they are translated, coverage reads 92%
(fr 524 translated, 44 left in English; pt 529 / 44).

`--allow-stale`, for the public build only (item 4): when `content.en.json` is
out of date the builder assembles the content from the source in memory
instead of refusing, writes nothing back, and leaves what is new in English.
Without the flag it refuses, as before.

**2. The three strings the engine always rejects are written by hand.** DEV-31
§4 lists three (`PQ'd` twice, `MFT` once, all DHA–PPQ) whose placeholders do
not survive the round trip. A rejected string is never saved, so every run
queued it again: `translate-strings.js` never reached "nothing to do", and a
run with nothing new still called Google and needed the key. Their French and
Portuguese are now in `translations.json` (keys `067f9f108ad6bf6f`,
`d8d25752df253a3f`, `368e55377d8c2ac7`), following the memory's own usage —
"première intention", "d’Asie du Sud-Est", European Portuguese "primeira
linha", PQ and MFT kept. **Drafted, not reviewed by a French or Portuguese
speaker — Jackson or a bilingual reviewer should check them.** The dry run now
queues 30 per locale, 1,559 characters, all of it new text; coverage 93%.

Found while writing them, left alone for the same reviewer: "WHO PQ held for
tablets and paediatric granules" reads in French as "OMS PQ **interdit** pour
les comprimés…" ("forbidden"), and masking pushes a protected term to the front
of its sentence ("MFT Modèles de déploiement avec…").

**3. The approval gate is wired (CP-4), and there is a stub engine.**
`approvalGate()` in `translate-strings.js` exits 1 unless
`APPROVED_CONTENT_HASH` is exactly the `contentHash` of the content it is about
to translate; a dry run needs no approval. The approval job passes the hash of
the proposal it is merging, the translate bot the hash now on `main`. A person
can still run it by hand, but only by setting the variable on purpose.
Rejected: the gate reading `data/decisions.js` itself — the approval job
translates before it merges and records, so the record would not exist yet.

`TRANSLATE_ENGINE=stub` returns `[stub-fr] <the English>` for every string, so
the route runs end to end with no key and nothing sent anywhere. A real engine
treats a stub value as an empty slot and overwrites it — the one exception to
"empty locale only", because a stub value is test output, not a translation.
`build-locale-pages.js` counts stub values it substitutes and says so. Checked:
no approval, a wrong hash, no key, and an unknown engine each exit 1 and leave
the memory untouched; the stub fills 30 per locale, a second run has nothing to
do, a Google dry run then sees those 30 slots as empty again, and the pages
build at 98% (12 left in English) with the stubs flagged.

## What `feat/translation` brought, and what we changed on it

| Where | Change |
|---|---|
| `docs/reviewer-feedback-parallel-gates-sep-2026.md` | restored — the branch had deleted it |
| `poc/` (8 files, 2,324 lines) | no longer tracked; added to `.gitignore` |
| `docs/translation-notes.md` | **new.** This file |
| `main`, separately | `b8c8d05` reverts proposal #15, the invented `TEST-0001` WHO listing |

## Decisions

**Pulled as a fast-forward.** Keith's branch was this repository's copy plus
four commits (`d163f6d`, `79f5f51`, `2598057`, `ee1181e` — DEV-31's
`assemble-content.js` and `content.en.json`), with nothing of ours on it to
reconcile.

**The reviewer-feedback doc is kept.** The branch deleted it in `bc13fe7`
("deleted", 11 Sep), which it inherited from `fix/sep9-feedback-parallel`, the
branch it was cut from. No reason is given and nothing in the translation work
depends on it being gone. A merge would have removed it silently: `main` has not
touched the file since `7e7b219`, so git sees no conflict. Restored from
`7e7b219`, which is byte-for-byte `main`'s copy. Rejected: taking the deletion.

**`poc/` leaves the branch.** `ed16f95` ("DEV-28: move engine comparison tooling
into gitignored poc/") meant it to stay local; `603b305` committed it the same
day, and `.gitignore` never listed it. It holds the engine-comparison script,
its French, Portuguese and French-surveillance outputs (HTML and JSON), and the
scoring sheet. Nothing outside `poc/` refers to it. It is the DEV-28 evidence,
so it stays recoverable: `git checkout 603b305 -- poc/`, or Keith's repository.
Rejected: keeping it — about 2,300 lines of engine output on `main`.

**`TEST-0001` reverted on `main` before anything is translated.** The second
end-to-end run (#15, `ec49635`) put the invented GanLum WHO listing back on
`main` after #4's revert. With it there, a merged tree's `content.en.json`
carried its sentence and the dry run queued it for Google.
`i18n/translations.json` cannot be regenerated identically, so a translated fake
would outlive the revert. Reverted in `b8c8d05` the same way as #4:
`data/products.js` is byte-for-byte `history/products-2026-09-08.js`, and
`publish.yml` accepted it, with nothing to commit. Rejected: leaving it and
skipping that one string, a skip every later translation run would have to
remember.

*Correction to `b8c8d05`'s message*, which says `history/products-2026-09-29.js`
"stays, as history is append-only". It does not exist: `b1b44a4` removed it on
29 Sep, and #15's `publish.yml` run failed at its commit step, so no snapshot was
written for it. No history file holds `TEST-0001`. `data/proposals.js` (3
mentions) and `data/decisions.js` (1) still do, as the record of the tests.

## Found in passing — to settle when the merge is scoped

From a trial merge of `ee1181e` into `main` at `b8c8d05`, in a scratch clone
(not pushed):

- **Git merges it without conflicts.** The verify block on an earlier trial
  merge (against `e0c3332`) was clean: normalizers byte-identical, validator
  0 errors / 5 warnings (3 + 2), synthetic 0 / 0, preview built, no NUL bytes.
- **`content.en.json` is out of date after the merge**, so
  `translate-strings.js` and `build-locale-pages.js` refuse to run until
  `assemble-content.js` is rerun. 3 strings are added and 21 removed: 405 in all
  (228 data, 61 markup, 116 js), against 423 on the branch. The dry run then
  sends 6 per locale, 568 characters — the 3 new strings and the 3 known
  `PQ'd`/`MFT` rejects.
- **Fixed in item 1 above.** **The sources footer breaks on the French and Portuguese pages.** `main`'s
  `9c6be45` moved the footer's source list out of the page into
  `data/sources.js`, rendered at runtime; those are the 21 removed strings.
  `assemble-content.js` reads only `products.js`, `resistance.js` and
  `molecular-markers.js`, and `build-locale-pages.js` copies only those into
  `dist/locale/<locale>/data/`. The locale page's `data/sources.js` is therefore
  missing and it shows "Source list unavailable — data/sources.js did not load."
  Coverage reads 97% (fr 503 translated, 17 left in English), against the
  branch's 525 / 14; the self-check passes because it checks the resistance rows
  only. The translations are still in `translations.json`, keyed by unchanged
  English, so reading `sources.js` should need nothing new sent to Google.
- **The approval check does not allow `content.en.json` in a proposal PR.**
  `proposal-decision.yml` merges only a PR whose one changed file is
  `data/products.js`. Rebuilding the content file after the merge, in
  `publish.yml`, fits that workflow's pattern (a generated file, one bot commit),
  but its path filter is `data/products.js` alone, and `content.en.json` also
  depends on `illustrated-journey-dashboard.html`, `resistance.js` and
  `molecular-markers.js`.
- **Resolved in item 3 above.** **CP-4 was still open.** `approvalGate()` in
  `translate-strings.js` only printed the hash.
- **The locale pages are not deployed.** `scripts/build-public-site.sh` copies a
  fixed list of files, and `dist/locale/` is not on it.
- **Two of the three `publish.yml` runs dispatched after an approval failed** on
  29 Sep: `59c116f` (#10) and `ec49635` (#15), the latter at "Commit snapshot,
  feed and linked-data export". The failed-step log came back empty, so the
  cause is not known; `59c116f`'s step was not checked.

## Status

- `feat/translation` on `KylerXiv/launch-development-test`: Keith's `ee1181e`
  plus this commit, pushed. It now differs from Keith's branch by this commit, so
  a later pull from Keith is a merge, not a fast-forward.
- `main`: `b8c8d05` pushed 30 Sep; validate, Vercel deploy and publish all
  succeeded.
- CI on `ee1181e`: "Validate dashboard data" succeeded.
- Verify block on this commit, 30 Sep: both normalizers byte-identical;
  `validate-data.js` 0 errors / 5 warnings (3 resistance + 2 molecular markers);
  synthetic 0 / 0; `make-preview.js` 154 KB. `assemble-content.js --check` up
  to date; `build-locale-pages.js` all checks passed, fr 525 / pt 530
  translated, 14 left in English each. No NUL bytes in any changed file.
